      <h3>Understanding HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS</h3>
      <p>
        The web, as we experience it daily, is built upon a foundation of three
        essential technologies — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Together, they form
        the core of every website and application you interact with, whether
        it's a simple blog or a complex web system.
      </p>
      <h3>HTML - The Structure of the Web</h3>
      <p>
        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) serves as the backbone of every web
        page. It defines the structure, layout, and logical hierarchy of the
        content. Think of it as the “skeleton” of a human body — it doesn't move
        or change colors, but it gives form to everything else. Every paragraph,
        image, button, and link you see on a website is represented by an HTML
        tag, such as p, img, button, or a. Without HTML, there would be no
        readable content for your browser to display.
      </p>
      <h3>CSS - The Art and Design</h3>
      <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) brings aesthetics and emotion to the web.
        It defines how elements look — the colors, fonts, spacing, borders, and
        animations. If HTML is the skeleton, CSS is the clothing, makeup, and
        personality that make a page visually appealing. Modern CSS supports
        powerful features such as Flexbox, Grid Layout, media queries for
        responsiveness, and animations for dynamic visual effects. A
        well-crafted CSS design can turn a dull structure into an immersive
        digital experience.
      </p>
      <h3>JavaScript - The Brain of Interactivity</h3>
      <p>
        JavaScript is what makes a website come alive. It adds logic, motion,
        and interaction, allowing the user to click, move, type, and see instant
        reactions from the system. With JavaScript, developers can validate
        forms, create dynamic animations, fetch live data, and even build entire
        applications that run directly in the browser. Frameworks and libraries
        such as React, Vue, or Node.js extend JavaScript's power far beyond the
        front-end, enabling complex web ecosystems.
      </p>
      <h3>Tailwind CSS - The Modern Efficiency</h3>
      <p>
        Tailwind CSS is a modern CSS framework that redefines how we style the
        web. Instead of writing long and repetitive CSS rules, Tailwind offers
        thousands of small, reusable classes — allowing developers to style
        elements directly in HTML with precision and consistency. For example,
        instead of writing:
      </p>
      <div class="code-box">
        <pre><code class="language-css">
button {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
  border-radius: 8px;
  padding: 10px;
}
  </code></pre>
      </div>

      <p>you can simply use:</p>

      <div class="code-box">
        <pre><code class="language-html">
&lt;button class="bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-lg p-2"&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;
  </code></pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        Tailwind promotes efficiency, customization, and clean design, making it
        a popular choice among modern developers. It’s a perfect companion for
        those who value structure, speed, and creative control.
