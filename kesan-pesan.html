      <h3>Reflecting on My Journey in Web Programming</h3>

      <p>
        Learning how to develop a website has been one of the most exciting
        experiences I've had in my studies. For years, I've always admired
        websites and wondered how people created such beautiful and interactive
        pages. Now, being able to design and build my own feels almost surreal.

        Ever since I was young, I've loved exploring creative worlds through
        <b>anime</b> and <b>video games</b>. They inspired me to dream about
        building something of my own â€” a digital space that reflects my ideas,
        interests, and imagination. Finally learning how to code and bring those
        dreams into reality feels incredibly rewarding.
